# Design Principles
- encapsulate what varies;
- classes should be open for extensions, but closed for modifications;
- progrmm to interface not to implementation;
- favor composition over inheritance;
- strive for loosely coupled design between objects that interact;
- depend upon abstractions, don't depend upon concrete classes (Dependency Inversion Principle);

# The Decorator Pattern
Decorators attach additional responsibilities to the objects dinamically. Decorators provide flexible alternatives to subclassing for extending functionality.
